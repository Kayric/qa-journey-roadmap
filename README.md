# 🧪 Quality Alchemist Journey – QA + CI/CD Gamified Roadmap

Welcome to my **public learning journey** into the world of Quality Engineering, Automation, and CI/CD.

I'm tracking my progress through a game-themed roadmap, where I treat each skill as a "quest", and each milestone as "XP".  
This isn't just a portfolio — it's my **Player Log** in the world of Dev + QA ⚔️👨‍💻
