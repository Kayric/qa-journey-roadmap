## 🔧 Key Concepts & Notes

Software Delivery Models
| Model | Detail | Phase |
|-------|------|------|
|**Waterfall Model** | traditional delivery model where development happens in a step by step manner | Requirements -> Design -> Development -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance | 
|**Agile Model** | development happens in short cycles, client provides feedback and request on prototype, typical every 2 weeks AKA Sprints | Plan -> Build -> Test -> Review |
|**DevOps Model** | Bringing development and operations together | Plan -> Code -> Build -> Test -> Integrate -> Deploy -> Operate -> Monitor |

DevOps Process
- **CI (Continuous Integration)** = automating the testing and merging of code changes
- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)** = automating release steps to staging or production
